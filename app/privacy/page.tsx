        <span>
          To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your
          verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in

        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you
          are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a
          verifiable request which must:
        </span>
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          <span>
            provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
            you are the person about whom we collected personal information or
            an authorized representative;
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to

          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <span>
          We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your
          identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our
          possession actually relates to you.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an
          account with us. We will use any personal information collected from
          you in connection with the verification of your request solely for the
          purposes of verification and shall not further disclose the personal
          information, retain it longer than necessary for purposes of
          verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can

          to act on your behalf.
